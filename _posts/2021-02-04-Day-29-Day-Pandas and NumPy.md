title: "Day 30: Pandas and NumPy"
---

Alright, well I spent all morning playing around with the NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn libraries and I think I made some progress but it’s slow going at first I guess. Learning about data frames, learning about NumPy arrays, how to make plots and visualizations, etc. I need to figure out how to do this stuff before I can start doing the labs and exercises in ISL. But it’s good. I also woke up at 5:15 AM and did some exercise which is a first for me. Usually, I just go straight into studying but yea, ran around a bunch and it felt good. Day-tight compartments. I definitely need to make a study plan still, although it’s hard to be too specific as a lot of the time honestly don’t know what I don’t know yet and I’ll start by studying statistics and end up needing to figure out how to use Pandas before I can even start. Which is OK I think.

Excited to go to Norway, I really hope I get in. I think I can provide great value to this world with that degree. Anyways, it’s breakfast time so ciao!
