title: "Day 23: Intro to Statistical Learning (ISL)"
---
Woah missed a couple days of journalling today! I keep studying right up to when I have to go do stuff and then don't get around to journalling later in the day. But today I will post again.

I Read the first chapter of the book "Introduction to Statistical Learning" today. 

This section contained an overview of the book, a brief history of statistical learning, an outline of the notation and linear algebra concepts that will be used, and the data sets that will be used in the labs.

It seems like the book is laid out similar to how statistical learning evolved, starting with linear regression and moving through non-linear stuff getting closer to present day developments with tree models and qualitative analysis.

I don't think I need to focus on linear algebra at this point as that would be mostly useful for ML algorithms and for now there are so many well tuned and optimized ML tools for me to use that I don't need to worry about making new ones.

I am going to start going through the sections and when I get to the R learning part, I will look up the Python version of whatever we are learning and attempt to complete the labs in Python. This will inevitably bring me into contact with a host of data, visualization, and ML algorithms and I may have to take breaks from this book to focus on my Python at those points in order to complete the lab. But as long as I am learning quickly, it doesn't matter how long it takes to complete this book.

I also be practiced the new text book reading methodology and found it to be quite effective for retaining the information that I read. This method is:
	1) Flip through each page of the chapter looking briefly at its contents but not reading anything
	2) Look at the end of the chapter for any quizzes or summaries and read through those. This will prime your brain to recognize the important take aways of the chapter before you start reading it
	3) Flip through each page of the chapter again, now reading only the bold print words (titles, subtitles, new vocabulary etc). These are the concepts you will be learning.
	4) Flip through each page again now reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph. This will often illustrate the concepts introduced, and the conlcusion of each paragraph.
	5) Finally, read the book, take notes, etc. I will be using my pencil to assist my eyes from straying too much and to focus my attention on the word I want to read, hopefully helping me to read faster.
