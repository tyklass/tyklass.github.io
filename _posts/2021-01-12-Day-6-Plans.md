Milestone project #1 today in my Python course: making an interactive tic-tac-toe game. I can see how you can waste a lot of time as a programmer. But each time you finally figure out what’s wrong, you learn something about how it works. I am already feeling that it’s going to be hard for me to justify wasting so much time on personal projects while learning this. But it’s better for me to learn this and make all these mistakes on my own so I can be more proficient once I actually start working.

Ordered “An Introduction to Statistical Learning” last night so I can start interleaving my programming study with Statistics study. I plan to ensure that I am spending at least an hour each morning doing Python practice to ensure that I develop muscle memory and really imprint this language. And I’m going to try to apply the stuff I’m learning in statistics to my Python ASAP so I can start combining them from the start. Pretty damn excited.

I need to make sure I don’t also lose focus on my Podcast. It feels like a waste of time and I can feel that I’m judging myself for wanting to have one. Like I’m not good enough to do it. But the updated plan is to get one started now, get a bunch of experience on “Talking with Tyler”, then start a new podcast once I start my program. I will keep it light for the first one and just interview people I know about their interests and personal views. Try to just have good conversations with each person. Then when I get to Norway, hopefully I’ll have worked out a lot of the kinks and be a better interviewer and then I’ll start my next podcast that is more focused on sustainability and future forecasting. While in Norway I have a feeling that I’m going to be meeting some amazing experts and 
I’ll have the chance to make some really cool podcasts.

Anyways, another 545AM wake up and 3hrs Python. I am really enjoying this.
