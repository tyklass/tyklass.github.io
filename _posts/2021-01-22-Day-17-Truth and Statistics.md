title: "Day 17: Truth and Statistics"
---
Alright look at that, another day another early wake up and study study. Found a nice free course on intro to statistics and I'm really enjoying how the professor is teaching it. Gives a good high level overview of the subject and how it is used and some of the pitfalls etc. Also the difference between statistical thinking vs machine learning thinking (stats: have a question, find data to answer said question. ML: have data, get answers from your data). I also really like the quote "if you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything‚Äù. I think thats a good thing to keep in mind. I really believe that there is an objective truth to the way things are and that the closer you can get to understanding that truth, the better off you will be. If you choose to act in a way that is not in line with the truth for personal gain it is another question, but so long as you are searching for the Truth and not just trying to prove your opinion.

Finally started understanding list comprihension! Haha not completely yet, but there was a practice problem with nested for loops and I couldn't figure out how it was running. But I got it, feels good.

Splitting my time between math youtube tutorials and python coding. Gives me a chance to interleaf my studies and also stretch while I watch the Youtube.

Gotta go, time for D&D.
