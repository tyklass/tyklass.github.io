title: "Day 12: Having a Plan"
--
Alright, another early start (5:15AM) and another 4hrs of studying and practice programs complete. Got into generators and iterators today and then stared searching out practice interview problems to start playing around with to get my brain thinking programming style.

Had a good chat with Agi, I think its awesome that I have this goal in mind for what I want to get out of my MSc degree and I'm really happy to be starting down this path. I am loving coding a lot. I get into flow state when I'm coding and it really seems like the time is flying by. You have to be really creative and logical which is super fun! I am enjoying the learning process and am excited to continue getting better so I can start tackling more advanced problems.

Also, part of me wonders if its worth going for my MSc... I don't really need it if for a new job, I just continue studying data science I'll be hirable soon enough and could start getting real life experience in that field. But I still think the life experience of living in Norway, plus the domain experience of sustainability will be worth it. Plus having a MSc is never really a bad thing. I'd like to get to the point where I can do a machine learning application for my master's thesis. Or if not, using some kind of words like "big data", "data science", or something along those lines so when I'm applying to jobs in that field I can say "my master's thesis was called 'applying machine learning to xxx...'" and companies can know that I have experience doing that.

Exciting stuff.
