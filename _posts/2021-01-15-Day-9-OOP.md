title: "Day 9: Object Oriented Programming"
--
Woops I forgot to blog yesterday! I was going to fake add one in so it would be continuous but that felt pretty lame so I’m not going to do that. I did get up at 6am yesterday and only got a couple hours of studying in before Leila woke up and we chatted.

Now I’m at the end of the ‘object oriented programming’ section of my python course and I’m doing a warm up project; create the game war that will be played between two computers. Pretty fun, it’s good for me to practice using the classes as I’m still a bit shaky on attributes and inheritance etc. So hopefully this will clean that up.

Dungeon mastered D&D with my friends last night, super fun but I told them I could only do once every other week as I don’t want to dedicate that many hours/week in preparing sessions. I want to keep doing it but for the majority of my free time to be spent learning data science and doing the podcasting.

Alright, its half way through the month, I’ve done one practice interview; my goal was 10 by the end of the month so I’ve got to up my game there. My main blockages are fear (I feel like an imposter), and also I don’t have an internet connection so I’m using my data only and the reception is kinda spotty here. I also don’t want to use up all my data recording phone calls but I should try one so I can see how it works. Alright, tonight I’m going to dedicate some time to my podcast.

Peace,
