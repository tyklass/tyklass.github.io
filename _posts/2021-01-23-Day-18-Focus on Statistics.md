title: "Day 18: Focus on Statistics"
---
Slept in till 8:30AM today! What the heck! But it was Sunday, so I had a nice morning with the wife and studied later in the day. Still got at least 3 hours in today (probably more) and its really fun. Starting to really feel that I'm getting used to Python at least a little bit. Using list comprehension and zip() and map(), the Hackerrank site is really helping to just crush a bunch of practice problems. Some are super hard! But I'm able to figure out most of the 'easy' ones.

Spoke with my friend Connor yesterday as he finished his MSc in Data Science last December and just got a job in the field so I wanted to ask him his opinion on learning strategies etc. He said that if I'm planning on using it for science, focus hard on the statistics as this will mostly be used in science. Unless I start doing more machine learning stuff, I probably won’t need my linear algebra and calculus. So perhaps what I'll do is focus for now on solely Python and stats (including the Python libraries for big data and visualizations), then later on start focusing on playing around with ML if I want to. I think having a really firm foundation in statistics will be necessary to be a good data scientist. Then leveraging my understanding of stats using ML. So that’s fun, I've got a couple stats text books now ("Think Stats", and "Introduction to Statistical Learning") which I'm going to work through using Python. This will hopefully give me a chance to practice doing visualizations too.

Also did my first day of yoga in the outbuilding, felt really nice. I think it’s really important for me to incorporate that into my daily routine as my body doesn't like all this sitting I'm doing.

Anyways, time to get off the computer and give my wife some attention.
