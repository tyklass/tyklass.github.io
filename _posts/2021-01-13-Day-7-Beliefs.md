title: "Day 7: Beliefs"
--
Completed my first milestone project, the Tic Tac Toe board and pushed it (? Still don’t understand gits lol) to my new github repo. I did it differently than the solutions did it, still works fine but I’m wondering if my way isn’t the cleanest. I’d really like to have clean code, which I know probably comes with experience as you learn more and more different ways of doing the same thing but I also want to make sure that I’m learning the best way right off the bat. Anyways, on to object oriented programming!

Not much else to report on, woke up at 5am this morning and did 3.5hrs of Python. I am excited for the idea of being able to wake up like this during my masters. I can’t even imagine, if I did 3.5 hrs of homework every morning, I’d get straight A’s and have most of my evenings and weekends off! Yes please. 

Had some really good meditations yesterday, definitely dropping in deeper to that. Starting to truly grasp how deeply I judge myself on everything I do/have done which is the first step of letting go of those things. It’s like I fundamentally believe (because I have judged myself as inadequate) that I deserve to be anxious and feel shame. But I think that by going in and sitting with those feelings without trying to change them at all and just observing what my beliefs are, they are slowly starting to dissolve. Beliefs are not these axioms of reality, they are a choice that you have decided to make but often don’t realize that you’ve made it and usually don’t think that it’s something you can just change. But as you sit with them and really observe your core beliefs, you realize they are just constructs of your mind that you have a choice whether or not to hold on to. Lots of work there still of course, but things are moving which feels good.

Ta ta for now.
