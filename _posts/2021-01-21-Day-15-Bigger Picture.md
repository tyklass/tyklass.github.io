title: "Day 15: Bigger Picture"
---
Ok, starting to put it more into perspective (I think). Getting into a FAANG high end data science job after 6 months of self-study; probably not feasible unless I totally get obsessed and spend 12hrs a day doing it. I am not really that person. I think it will be tough for me to get a data analytics job after 6mo so that’s, not really a great option. On the other hand, getting a MSc and focusing on the analytics, the science part of it, then using data analytics through my program gives me a domain in which to have expertise and apply my data science. I'm saying this because I've been thinking if I even need to go get a MSc in Norway or just skip it and start applying to data analytics positions once I have enough skills. Also, I think I might be putting the cart in front of the horse a bit with thinking that the pure data part of it is the most interesting part. It’s hard to say because I'm still not able to really do analysis on my own yet, getting closer but I'm still just starting to see all the fundamentals of this massive field. In any case, I need to focus on finding things that excite me and not worry about what part of data science it is, just do projects on the things that interest me (while still trying to apply all the different pieces).

Also, another one of my real gifts and things that I love is communicating. I have a belief that this 'soft' skill is worth less than my programming skills because of all the high salaries that data scientists have. But I should not shy away from one of my real skills because of that. Keep working with it. Do my podcast. Write stuff. Talk with interesting people about interesting things and learn cross disciplinary. Find my niche. I'm not nerd enough or obsessed enough to be at the very top of pure machine learning and AI nerd-dom. And that's OK. I can be conversant in both, have some skills in both enough to understand how and where they can be applied. And communicate effectively between all education and technical knowledge levels.

Anyways. Still stoked and learning lots, just starting to think about my niche in this new world. How can I maximize my value to this world? Doing things that I am passionate about (that also make money hahah). 

I'm also going to start thinking about laying out personal expectations for myself and redefining my goal with this endeavour and how it fits into the larger picture of my interests, health, career, marriage, etc. Then I can relax into my plan (keeping it current by constantly obsessing if I'm doing the right thing ofc.) and be intentional about how I proceed. What is important to me? If nothing else, this has really got me thinking about how I spend my time.

Bye for now,
