title: "Day 2: Journaling"

Alright day 2, starting to get into functions and methods in Python which is exciting. Starting to think about applications and working on cryptocurrency prediction models (which would be super cool!).

My goal for my podcast is to do ten practice interviews in January, then record my first official podcast by February 1. I've done one practice with my wife which was fun and showed me a lot of stuff to work on (better intro, a warm up chat to get both our nerves out, better transitions between questions etc.). I've also decided to rename the podcast Future Talk Today and it will be about the future of different people's industries and the changes they see happening in their industry. It will be awesome for me to keep my finger on the pulse of the future. Might be a better name somewhere in there to be honest, Future Pulse, Pulse of the Future, Finger on the Pulse. Hmmm, might change it again, but I guess it doesn't really matter at this point, can always rename it.

Anyways, today I'm going mushroom picking as it is matsutake season in California and I am hyped. So only did a couple hours of study so far. D&D tonight as well.

That's all for now, peace!
