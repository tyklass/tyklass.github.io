title: "Day 3: What is this Blog?"

What is this blog? Am I just going to record my new insights or am I going to just journal and write whatever I am thinking at the time? I think I’ll just make it open and write everything that is going on for me every day.

So yesterday I went mushroom picking and got about 5lbs of super tasty pine mushrooms and I’m pretty hyped about that. I also had my first game of D&D with the new group and I think I may have kinda fucked it up slightly. Not terribly, but I think there’s room for improvement. I think I wasn’t really role playing very well, was doing a lot of meta-gaming and I think it made the experience less fun for people. Adrian in particular, but also Mal. I told Adrian that he should be the navigator because he was the best at navigation, which I dunno,  it’s true but I may have offended Mal. Anyways, next game I’m going to try to get into the mindset of my character more, who is Puck? What would he do? Not what would I do, as a player. Lots to learn.

Today I’ve started getting more into functions in Python, and it’s starting to get more interesting. The problems are getting more challening which is fun. Also, I’ve been trying to get up at 6am every day so I can get 3 hours of studying in each morning before I start the day. Not sure if that’s the best for my body, I might try to do 1hr of yoga/meditation, then 2hrs of studying in the morning and try to get another hour in the evening. We’ll see. I think the yoga and meditation is still super important and I don’t want to neglect that just because I’m really obsessed with this goal now.

Also need to start putting some more effort into the podcast because I still think that is an avenue that would be awesome to pursue and get off the ground before I go to Norway. I’m going to have the opportunity to speak with some really interesting people there and I want to be ready.
