title: "Day 29: Day-Tight Compartments"
---

Well my daily blogging is not going super well, but my studies are still continuing and currently focusing my learning on statistics, Pandas, Numpy, and general technology trends (through audiobooks like Digital Transformation). Still excited to go to Norway, and started thinking today about how everything is moving towards service rather than ownership which makes me excited for the circular economy. Essentially I think its not going to be a grass roots thing as much as competing product service providers that want to minimize their costs by having highly robust internal circular economies. The better they are able to re-use the products that they provide as a service (electric vehicles, smartphones etc.), the lower their costs will be for updating, maintaining, and reusing their products. Designers will need to focus more on re-usable materials, and ease of disassembly, cradle-to-cradle design that makes circular economies within companies thrive.

I just watched a good Youtube video on studying and I think it will help me in my day to day life as well. Its time that I start making specific study plans, and excecuting on them. Then focusing each day just on the plan I have laid out. If I am writing and re-writing my plan on the fly as I go, then its almost like I'm overfitting the data of my life and I will chase many signals that are just noise. You can't be too flexible or you will over-fit, but you also need to ensure that you are flexible enough that you can adjust along the way. I'm going to try to write one-week study plans for the week to come, then just execute the plan and focus hard. At the end of the week, I'll write a new plan for the next week. Also, I think its time that I start doing some form of excercise before studying. Its usually still dark out, but going for a quick jog, or doing some jumping jacks, or doing pretty much anything to get my heart rate up first thing in the morning will be very benificial for my brain. My sleeping habits are pretty good, I should try to organize my workspace slightly more before studying, but I'm generally pretty good.

I do like the idea of living in day-tight compartments. Focusing on the tasks at hand, complete the goals I have for that day. So that means that I need to have goals. Time to start scheduling my time better.

Alright, thats enough for now.

Peace,
