title: "Day 13: Elite Data Science"
---
So I've stumbled across this site, and I really like their approach to learning data science and machine learning. They seem to focus on applied methods and finding ways of getting practitioners to be able to deliver results rather than deep theoretical knowledge. Also I like their idea of learning by DOING as much as possible. I'm getting to the point in my Python course where its starting to get into stuff that I feel that I'll probably not use regularly, and probably won't remember. So I want to start shifting to the other fundamentals needed for data science and then start getting into projects on Kaggle. I also like the idea of having individual projects for each of the varius areas of machine learning and data science and building a portfolio as I learn. I definitely learn much faster when I am doing projects. So I'm not sure that I'll do their payed course, but I'll use their model of balancing theoretical with practical as much as possible.

I'm also having a lot of trepidation around doing my MSc. Is it worth it? Two more years time investment when I could potentially get a data analyst job and start making money and career advancement is a big deal. But at the same time... living and studying at an amazing university in Norway? Getting systems engineering skills? While applying data science and machine learning to my projects? Might be an awesome way to get highly skilled at data science and get to do a cool MSc program at the same time. I'm worried that I won't have enough time to do my data science stuff... but hopefully I'll be able to use it for my projects at school. Leila reallllly wants to go, so if I get in, I'll still probably go.

A short day of study today (2hrs) had a terrible sleep cuz of a wind storm.

Hopefully can get up early tomorrow and get some hrs in.

Peace.
