title: "Day 16: Practice and Rant"
---
Day 16 woot! The 5:15AM train is rollin in! It’s been the only way I’m able to dedicate 3-4hrs a day of uninterrupted study and it makes me excited for the MSc because it’s going to give me so much extra time each day! I spent most of the morning doing Hackerrank practice Python problems and it was really good for me to play around with nested lists etc. Also started getting into the Numpy lib a little bit, but I realized that I now know how to do cross products and stuff but I don’t really remember what those are and what they are for! So I found (also on Hackerrank) that there are practice linear algebra and statistics problems which I’m going to play around with. I also started watching the 3 blue 1 brown “Essence of Linear Algebra” series which is really helpful as they have awesome visualizations for everything making it really easy to understand.

It’s been hard for me to stay calm about the MSc tbh. I get really freaked out about being so ‘behind’ financially because I’ve been unable to work in the US while I wait for my delayed (read COVID) immigration papers to go through. By July it will have been 2 years since I’ve had a real job! That’s insane. It gives me a stomach ache thinking about it and makes me wonder if I’m being hella irresponsible spending another 2 years without employment. But I’ll come out of it with a MSc in an area that I’m interested in, hopefully a podcast, and the fundamental skills to be at least an entry level data analyst (although I’d prefer being at entry level data scientist skill level if possible). 

So hopefully I’ll be able to find a job pretty quick after Norway that is in an area that I really enjoy and I can just relax into it and start to work.
Anyways, I’m really enjoying programming and math so that’s cool. Hyped to start some personal projects soon.
