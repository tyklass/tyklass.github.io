title: "Day 11: Blackjack"
--
Hmmm well, I missed posting again yesterday. Might become a habit lol. I have been working on the second milestone project of the Python course I'm taking. Programmed a one player Blackjack game that works well but isn't the most pretty thing in the world. I went through the solutions after completing the project on my own and programmed it their way too. I can see how it cleans it up to have so many different functions and classes. I think its like in physics where if you start replacing variables with numbers too soon then your equations become a huge mess so the trick is to just use variables only all the way to the very end and then input your numbers at the end. I will try to do this with my next program. I guess you go through the whole program and try to write out all the logic for your program first, then go in and write functions and classes to populate the whole thing. I used a lot more methods than the solutions, not sure if thats better or worse...

Anyways, the wife is home from silks. Progress is good. Oh yea, I spoke to my friend Phil who is really into trading stocks and we started talking about using algorithms for trading. I think that is going to be my personal project. I'm going to try to get him to make his research into searchable data variables that I can write automate using a program. A company filter that can go through a large number of company websites (or company summary pages of some kind) and rank companies on whether or not they are good investments. At the same time looking at the shape of their trading graphs and taking into account the head and shoulders shapes etc. I'm starting to get excited about investing again, which is cool.

Anyways, studied for 3 hrs yesterday and like 8 hrs today so its good.

Peace!
