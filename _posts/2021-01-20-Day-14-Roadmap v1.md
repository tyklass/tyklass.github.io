title: "Day 14: Roadmap v1"
---
Alright! Two weeks down! Still fired up about data science and machine learning, even more hyped than ever to be honest! Starting to develop my roadmap: 

1) I am through the basics of my Python training, there are few more subjects left in the fundamentals course but I am going to leave them until I need them. I have enough to get started. (2 weeks completed, ~52hrs)

2) Next up is learning linear algebra, calculus, statistics and probability through programming in Python. This will keep me developing my basic Python skills while at the same time developing the fundamentals for good data science and ML.

3) After that will be to start learning data science and machine learning tools and applying them to some small projects that highlight each of the foundational skills/tools of DS and ML. 

4) Then putting it all together on some bigger personal projects.

In each of these sectinos I want to really focus on DOING and APPLYING and using Python as much as possible to visualize and conceptualize what I'm learning.
