title: "Day 4: Keeping On"
---
Day 4 and I’ve got another 3.5 hours into studying. Playing around with some practice examples of functions, I’m still a beginner but feeling better every day. I woke up at 5:45 this morning to give myself extra time to study, I seem to have a lot of motivation first thing which is good. I’m also starting to feel my body revolting against sitting without moving around or stretching first so I think I might have to do a warm-up first thing then hit the books. This is also something that was recommended by the “Learning to Learn” course I took as exercise increases production of bdnf (miracle grow for neurons) and reduces cortisol. Also, I think my body will not do well if I don’t start stretching and whatnot before coding. Unfortunately I don’t have a great place to do that in the trailer so I’ll have to do it outside and it’s pretty chilly first thing. Oh well, gotta do it.

Started looking at statistics courses, lots of stuff offered on Coursera, but  I think I want to get my fundamentals of Python stronger so I can program my stats right into Python and get experience like that. At the same time, I want to do ‘interleaving’ of study subjects which is also another way of increasing efficiency and retention. So perhaps I’ll just start taking the Khan Academy Stats and Probability courses to begin and then start applying them as I go.

Lots to learn! Also want to start making a learning list at some point, but I figure as long as I’m putting my time in each day, and not spending too much time on any one thing, and also doing lots of practice problems and personal projects, I should be good. Almost at the point where I could start a personal project but not quite there.
Ciao for now!
